# myCopyProgram
This program allows the user to copy any file type they want into either a) a valid existing file or b) a new file that will be created upon call. Using system calls such as read() and write(), we are able to create an identical version of the source file in the destination file. 

NOTE: This file must be run on a POSIX compliant system, i.e. Mac OS, Linux, Solaris, or the any Linux flavor shell on a windows machine (vscode has a useful WSl extension for accomplishing this)
